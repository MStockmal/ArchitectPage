He opened his own office in Chicago in 1924, the same year he moved his young family to a small house of his own design at 327 S. Oak in Hinsdale. Although Zook was busy during the 1920s, the Depression of the 1930s took its toll on his business. Zook was involved in the choosing of Edwin H. Clark, the architect for the Memorial Building and in 1932 was chairman of the Hinsdale Plan Commission. Ultimately, Zook built 31 houses and 6 commercial buildings in Hinsdale. He also designed the Art Deco Municipal Building in St. Charles City Hall and the Pickwick Theatre in Park Ridge. Most of his houses are exceptionally crafted with detailed woodwork and hardware, patterned brickwork, decorative leaded glass windows and unusually complex rooflines. Zook houses are still instantly recognizable.

He was a long-time resident of Hinsdale, building his first house here in 1912 at 136 South Oak Street. He later moved to 112 North Lincoln Street and remained there for the rest of his life. The Hinsdale Theatre, with its beautiful cream-colored terra cotta ornament, is typical of the best commercial work of the 1920s. Unlike his contemporary, R. Harold Zook, Barfield was drawn to the simplicity of the Craftsman and Prairie styles for his house designs. The design of 441 East Third Street reflects his love of the Prairie Style's horizontality, simple stucco and wood wall surfaces and large expanses of window. Â· 138 North Grant Street (1921)

Born in New Jersey, his family came to Chicago when he was ten. He attended classes in architecture at the University of Illinois while working as a carpenter. He became acquainted with Wright's work in Oak Park on one of his many long evening walks, applied for a position, and was hired within days. He also worked as a draftsman for Richard Schmidt and D. H. Burnham during the same time. From 1910 -1915 Drummond partnered with Louis Guenzel. After that he practiced alone, abandoning the Prairie style after World War I.

He arrived in Chicago in 1867 and worked with Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux to design the picturesque suburb of Riverside. Jenney also helped plan Chicago's boulevard and park system. He is most well known, however, for his work in developing the steel-framed skyscraper and for training a generation of Chicago architects in the 1870s and 1880s. William Mundie, the son and grandson of Canadian architects, joined Jenney in 1884 and became his partner in 1891. The house at 134 North Lincoln Street, locally known as "the terra cotta house", was built for the owner of the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company.

In 1887, he joined the office of Shingle style architect Joseph L. Silsbee as a draftsman, where he worked with fellow draftsman Frank Lloyd Wright. During the 1890s he worked in a variety of styles, his Shingle and Queen Anne projects were widely reviewed in the Inland Architect journal during this time period. By the late 1890s his work began to reflect characteristics of the Prairie style and he is considered on the pioneer Prairie style architects along with Frank Lloyd Wright, Purcell & Elmslie, and Walter Burley Griffin. He developed the campus plan for Northwestern University in 1907 and designed Swift Hall and Patten Gymnasium on that campus. After World War I, Maher became a vocal proponent of community planning and prepared development plans for Glencoe and Kenilworth.

											<h4 class="card-title">Eben Ezra "E.E." Roberts</h4>
											<p class="card-text">Roberts first worked for S.S. Beman (Sr.) in Pullman as a site superintendent starting in 1889. He set up his own practice in Oak Park in 1893, where he designed nearly 200 houses. Although he worked in a variety of styles, his work favored the Prairie style of his Oak Park contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright. The house at 231 East Third Street was designed for A. W. True in a bold Prairie style with deep eaves and bands of windows set in dark wood trim. In 1912 Roberts moved his office to Chicago and began to concentrate more on commercial designs, including several important buildings in Oak Park. He retired in 1926, leaving his practice to his son Elmer.

											<p class="card-text">This well-known Boston architectural firm established a Chicago office in 1888 and played an important role in the master plan and designs for the University of Chicago, the Art Institute and the Chicago Public Library (now the Chicago Cultural Center). Although they inherited the practice of H. H. Richardson in 1886, the firm turned away from Richardson's Romanesque Revival to embrace the Renaissance Revival made famous by the 1893 Columbian Exposition. The house at 244 East First Street, with its Classical details and symmetry, is a skillful example of their work. The carriage house on Elm Street was moved and converted to residential use in 1955.

											<h4 class="card-title">Philip Duke West</h4>
											<p class="card-text">Graduating from the University of Michigan in 1929, West weathered the Depression as a designer and draftsman at important Chicago architectural firms, including Holabid &amp; Root and Schmidt, Garden &amp; Erickson. In 1947 he set up his own practice in Hinsdale, where he had begun designing buildings in the 1930s. He was responsible for numerous public buildings in Hinsdale (including the present Police and Fire Station on Symonds Drive) and served on the Plan Commission starting in 1950. The best of his work was executed in the International Style, with ribbons of metal-framed windows set in simple limestone bands and red brickwork.
